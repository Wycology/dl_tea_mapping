# Deep Learning Session

This repository contains teaching materials (Lecture slides and notebook) for the **[Workshop on Satellite Data for Agricultural and Environmental Economics]**, organized for doctoral students. This particular module focuses on applying deep learning techniques to map tea plantations at the foot of Mount Kenya using satellite imagery and Python (via Google Colaboratory).

### Module Focus: Tea Mapping in Kenya
- **Objective**: Introduce how deep learning (CNNs) can be applied to classify and map agricultural crops.
- **Case Study**: Tea plantations in Kenya.
- **Data**: Sentinel-2 imagery and associated training labels.
- **Tool**: Google Colab (no installation needed).
